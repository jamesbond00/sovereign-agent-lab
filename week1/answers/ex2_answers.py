None of the known venues meet the capacity and dietary requirements. The Albanach, The Haymarket Vaults, and The Guilford Arms have a capacity of 180, 160, and 200 respectively, which is less than the required capacity of 300. The Bow Bar has a capacity of 80, which is also less than the required capacity, and it is currently full. Therefore, none of the known venues can accommodate 300 people with vegan options.

SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
Indeed, the sort of scenarios where non-booking related queries should be filtered out as this is beyong the booking agent scope.
The booking agent should be able to handle these cases and let users know that other than booking requests won't be processed.
Also it is good to know that the guardrails are in place so no wasting precious tokens on non-related/non-accepted enquiries.

what to do at every step. The graph is just a loop with impliciting routing.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
I think in general what I like is that agent independetnly decides what to do
at every step. We just provide it with the tools or exact tasks which can be 
done in order to answers users questions. What I really like about is how the agent
can filter out out-of-scope queries, e.g. TASK C / Scenario 3 — Out of Scope
where it was asked about the train schedule which is not part of its responsibilities.
